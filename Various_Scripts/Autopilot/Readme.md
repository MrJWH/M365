Before using the provided `.bat` file, you **must** update the script with your specific credentials:

- **Tenant ID**
- **App ID**
- **App Secret**

Open the `.bat` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual Azure AD details.  
**Do not share your credentials publicly.**

Once updated, you can run the script as intended.

The `.bat` file is designed to always download the latest version of the PowerShell script directly from this GitHub repository before execution. This ensures you are running the most up-to-date script with any recent improvements or fixes.
